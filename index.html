            <h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
            <p><b>
              Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
              durable images by recording light, either electronically by means
              of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
              material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields
              of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business,
              as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video
              production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

        <p class="history">
           Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries, relating to seeing an image and capturing the image. The discovery of the camera obscura ("dark chamber" in Latin) that provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient China. Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.[11][12] In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments.[13]<br><br>

           The Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965â€“1040) also invented a camera obscura as well as the first true pinhole camera.[12][14][15] The invention of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham.[16] While the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier,[16] Ibn al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis of the camera obscura,[17] including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon,[18] and was the first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could be projected onto a screen on the other side.[19] He also first understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole,[20] and performed early experiments with afterimages, laying the foundations for the invention of photography in the 19th century.[15]
